# Introduction

Data curation in the field of neuroimaging is a fundamental task necessary for creating scalable, reproducible science. To aid in their efforts, researchers have the option to have their data hosted by private vendors, whose infrastructure may mitigate some of the challenges of storing, organising, and tracking massive amounts of data. One such vendor, Flywheel, provides some solutions for this, but researchers ultimately must be able to curate their data themselves on a case-by-case basis to fit scientific standards. In the field of neuroscience, the current standard is the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) **[REF BIDS HERE]** paradigm, an open-source specification of how to store and share neuroimaging files. Flywheel allows users to curate their data using BIDS, but lacks sufficient flexibility for the large variety of use-cases in neuroimaging data collection. `fw-heudiconv` is a toolkit for flexible, reproducible, and user-friendly curation of data on Flywheel's platform.
